# Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection

The goal is to successfully classify plant diseases by image-based identification of the plant leaves. The project aims to detect and provide the crop-disease pair for the crops or indicate if they are healthy otherwise. Machine learning would help identify these crop diseases quicker, identify newer diseases in crops farmers may not have seen in this part of the world which will greatly benefit the Canadian agricultural industry Additionally, this tool could be used in smaller farms where inexperienced farmers could identify the disease and treat it accordingly.
